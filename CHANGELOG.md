# ClusterBuster Changelog

## Project Objective
ClusterBuster is an AI-powered analysis tool for Windows Failover Cluster logs. It helps users investigate and diagnose cluster issues by processing log files and providing intelligent analysis.

## Core Features
- Case-based investigation system
- AI-powered log analysis
- Interactive timeline visualization
- Root cause analysis generation
- Knowledge base integration
- Dark/Light mode support

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Frontend UI (Completed)
- [x] Basic project structure with React and Tailwind
- [x] Responsive layout with navigation
- [x] Dashboard with status cards
- [x] Cases list with status tracking
- [x] Case view with tabbed interface
- [x] Analysis visualization with swimlane graph
- [x] Event table with filtering
- [x] Settings page with AI server configuration
- [x] Dark mode implementation
- [x] Time window selector

### Phase 2: Backend Integration (In Progress)
- [x] Weaviate RAG database setup
- [x] Database schema definition
- [x] Agent configuration structure
- [ ] Agent container setup
- [ ] Agent communication channels
- [ ] API endpoint definitions
- [ ] Frontend-to-Container communication testing
  - [ ] RAG database connectivity
  - [ ] Agent system integration
  - [ ] Event streaming setup
  - [ ] Error handling and recovery
  - [ ] Data persistence verification

### Phase 3: AI Integration (Planned)
- [ ] Ollama/LMStudio integration
- [ ] Log processing pipeline
- [ ] Analysis generation
- [ ] Knowledge base management
- [ ] Chat interface

### Phase 4: Docker Implementation (Planned)
- [ ] Frontend container
- [ ] Agent container
- [ ] Full docker-compose setup
- [ ] Production deployment configuration

## Next Steps
1. Implement API endpoints for RAG database interaction
2. Set up agent communication channels
3. Test frontend-to-container communication
4. Verify data flow between components
5. Begin AI integration

## Notes
- Frontend UI is complete and ready for backend integration
- Database schema is defined and ready for implementation
- Agent structure is defined and ready for development
- Need to test container communication before UI containerization
- Focus on data persistence and error recovery
